## Purpose
Discord-Waterbottle is a project designed to help members of Discord servers stay hydrated by reminding them at regular intervals to drink something.

## Setting Up
### Prerequisites
This project requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) 16.x or higher in order to function properly.

## Install Dependancies
`npm install` for all dependancies, `npm install -production` for only production dependancies.

## Configuration
Once dependancies have been installed, open a terminal in the root directory and run `npm run config` and follow the prompts. Once you have done this, go to `src/core/config/sample` and copy message.json into `src/core/config` and adjust the message. 

*Note: Thumbnail and Image links must be direct links to the images and be resolvable by discord, an error will be thrown if they are not._*
